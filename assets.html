				<h3> How to add in a fancy modal using fancybox </h3>
				<code> Note: there is a JS file for fancybox, a sass file and the init statement in the main js file that are necessary but dont need to be touched for adding modal items</code>
				<pre>
					// To start, create an 'a' tag wrapped around your item that will trigger modal on click
					// it will require a class of fancybox and an href with the id of the modal content
					&lt;a href="#modal-content-1" class="fancybox"&gt; CLICK this to see MODAL! &lt;/a&gt;

					// After creating your button, or wrapping content in the fancybox 'a' tag to enable the
					// modal, create a div with the ID you targeted with your href in the fancybox 'a' tag 
					// and a class of modal-window that applies the correct css to your modal
					&lt;div id="modal-content-1" class="modal-window"&gt;
						EVERYTHING YOU WANT INSIDE YOUR MODAL POPUP GOES IN HERE IN HTML FORM 
						&lt;div class="modal-title"&gt; TITLE &lt;/div&gt;
						&lt;div class="modal-text"&gt; DESCRIBE WHAT THIS MODAL IS ABOUT &lt;/div&gt;
						&lt;div class="modal-pic"&gt; &lt;img src="file/path.jpg" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
					 &lt;/div&gt;

					 // Also note that the modal-window sass can be edited in the _cirro.sass file and is the 
					 // styling on the modal window. Right now it has display: none so its hidden until modal 
					 // is triggered. Another class can be used as well if desired, and is not connected to 
					 // modal js or anything so you can also have multiple classes for multiple modal 
					 // stylings. Just dont forget to display: none the content so thats its not shown on page

					 // Further, since .modal-window HTML is (and needs) display: none, it can be placed
					 // anywhere on the page. Currently all my modals on example page are located at the 
					 // bottom of the document all inside &lt;section class="modal-content"&gt; just for 
					 // organization

					<p>To add a button with an icon, add a span with a class of icon in the button before the text. We use Entypo icon font for all icons. <a href="http://www.entypo.com/" target="_blank">http://www.entypo.com/</a></p>

					<h3>Forms</h3>
					<p>All forms default to 100%. If you want them smaller wrap a  group of them with a width wrapper found in the scaffolding</p>
					<p class="text-warning">! All associated buttons should match the width of the input field. For full width buttons add the class .full</p>

					<h3>Scaffolding</h3>
					<p>
						Our goal was to create a scaffolding structure that was simplified down to a few basic structures, halfs, thirds, and quarters. Often times scaffolding helpers are too intensive and this is an attempt to have truely an utilitarian scaffolding based simply on our needs.
					</p>
					<h4>Use as paragraph scaffolding</h4>
					<pre>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="half"&gt; 
      &lt;div class="inner"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="quarter"&gt;
       &lt;div class="inner"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="quarter"&gt;
       &lt;div class="inner"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
					</pre>
						<h4>Simple layout scaffolding</h4>
						<p>The scaffolding can also be used as a simple layout tool. In this case just use the container and the associated spacer, leaving out the row wrapper and the inner div. </p>
					<pre>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="half"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="half"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
